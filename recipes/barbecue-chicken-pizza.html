    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

    <p>This quick and easy barbecue chicken grilled pizza recipe is for those summer cookouts. I often make it as an appetizer while the ribs are cooking. Use whatever toppings you normally like on regular pizza, but the barbecue chicken is always a crowd-pleaser! The dough never makes a perfect rectangle, but we have fun guessing what it looks like ("That looks like America!"). For the chicken, I use pre-cooked grilled chicken from the store.</p>
