# odin-recipes

A project made for the curriculum of [The Odin Project Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations).

What began as a challenging introduction to web development became an enjoyable creative process. The initial struggles with Git commits eventually turned into a valuable skill through persistent practice.
